# Mods to avoid --- DON'T INSTALL THIS EVER! ---

This suggestions are from the Buffout 4 tutorial page:

| Mod | Problem/s that it gives |
|----------|----------|
| Damage Threshold Framework | Can crash in combat on some occasions due to how damage calculations are done. |
| Extreme Particles Overhaul (EPO) | Can cause particle crashes. |
| Fallout Sakhalin﻿ | Breaks the precombine system all across Far Harbor DLC which is bound to randomly crash your game. |
| Fatigues Extended﻿ | Seems to conflict with Looks Menu in some way, potentially breaks BoS NPCs and causes crashes. |
| NCR Renegade Armor﻿ | Outfit has broken mesh that crashes the game in 3rd person or when NPCs wearing it are hit. |
| Scrap Everything | Weird crashes and issues due to multiple unknown problems. |
| Shade Girl Leather Outfits﻿ | Can crash the game while browsing the armor workbench or upon loading or starting a new game. |
| Spring Cleaning﻿ | Abandoned and severely outdated mod that breaks precombines and could potentially even break your save file. |
| True Nights | Has an invalid Image Space Adapter (IMAD) Record that will corrupt your save memory and has to be manually fixed. |
| War Of The Commonwealth﻿ | Seems to cause consistent crashes with specific spawn points or randomly during settlement attacks. |
| Flip a Coin﻿ | Uses several incorrectly sized images. |
| S.T.A.L.K.E.R Texture Overhaul | Doesn't work due to incorrect folder structure. Has one corrupted texture. |
| Armor And Weapon Keywords (AWKCR)﻿ | Possibly causing some "Player Character" crashes. |
| Armorsmith Extended﻿ | Might crash the game on startup or when accessing workbenches as described by older reports. |
| Combat Rifle Overhaul﻿ | Apparently a few custom magazines or ammo types from this mod can causes crashes for some. |
| Endless Warfare﻿ | Some enemy spawn points could be bugged or crash the game, either due to scripts of pathfinding. |
| Give Me That Bottle﻿ | Seems to be responsible for some Pip-Boy inventory crashes. Consider switching to Fill'em Up Again﻿. |
| Immersive Hunting Overhaul﻿ (IHO) | Might be responsible for a couple of recent crashes during the game startup. |
| NPC Level Scaling﻿ | Seems to cause crashes while fast traveling or approaching certain places due to unknown reasons. |
| Respawnable Legendary Bosses﻿ | Sometimes causes Deathclaw/Behmoth boulder projectile crashes for unknown reasons. |
| Tactical Tablet﻿ | Can cause flickering with certain scopes, early reports mention occasional crashes while browsing workbenches. |
| Fallout 4 High Resolution DLC | Yes, the official DLC. Linked to several weird problems and crashes. Always keep it disabled. |
| Clean My Settlement﻿ | Edits pretty much every cell in the game, so unintended or random conflicts can be a problem. |
| Fallout 3 Holotape | Known to conflict with and break mods with custom Pip Boy models, such as the Pip Boy 2000. |
| Load Accelerator﻿ | Uses outdated / intrusive methods to increase loading screen framerates, stick to High FPS Physics Fix﻿ only. |
| Lootable Stoves﻿﻿ | Breaks precombined data in several different cells which might result in major framerate drops at certain places. |
| Locky Bastard﻿ | Can very rarely cause the game to freeze while melee attacking doors or when NPCs try to get through locked doors. |
| Phase 4 Institute Expansion | Its plugin must be cleaned as it contains 1300 UDRs and 30 ITMs. See Additional Troubleshooting below. |
| Uneducated Shooter﻿ | Causes white screen glitch after character creation for most players. Simply save, exit to main menu and load again. |
| XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle﻿ | There have been reports that this weapon causes many random issues and heavy script lag (>30%). |
| T6M's Perks Pack﻿ (& other perk mods) | Keep these mods last / at the end of your load order to avoid conflicts and ensure full functionality. |

# Tested and discarded mods (tested by Jaume)

| Mod | Problem/s |
|----------|----------|
| The British Consulate General | Gives a crash when following Paladin Danse through the road, checked 23/5/2024. Also gives crashes in workbench or selling around Goodneighbour related to CombatArmor_palette_d.DDS |
| Raider Gang Extended DLC Compatibility Update | NO! crash around USS riptide wreck (in the bridge to Diamon City), with next gen update, 19/5/2024 |
| Capital Wasteland Behemoths NO! | Too much difficult! Although tested and they look and behave good they are too much difficult. |
| FlaconOil's Complete Retexture Project. | NO! Gives a lot of conflicts with other mods in the modlist and performance problems and a heavy drop of FPS in certain areas. |
| Immersive Facial Animations REMADE - IFAR. | NO! Too exaggerated facial animations even in the lowest presets. |
| Faction Housing Overhaul of Elianora. | Prydwen house appears even if you haven't been there, plus there are purple meshes in the safe when you really go there. |
etc.
| Welcome to Goodneighbor | Not recommended, not immersive. Quest with dialog lines blank. No voiced protagonist. |

# Warnings / Remembers

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| The protagonist's voice is silent when looking into the mirror at the start of the game! | Be sure to go to Steam, properties of the game and change the language to "English"! (found 5/11/23). Happened to me because Steam detected my language as Spanish and didn't care to install the English language files. |
| I want to avoid the Bethesda logo intro. | Open steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\Video\ and delete or rename the file “GameIntro_V3_B.bk2” |
| I don't remember how to turn on/off the pip-boy flashlight. | **HOLD** tab key! |
| I need to remove Piper's Hat because it's clipping with her hair. | Console ("ñ" key in Spanish keyboard, the key left to 1 in English keyboard) and write "2f1f.unequipItem a81af" and then "2f1f.removeItem a81af" |
| I don't remember how to activate the V.A.T.S. in combat. | Use the Q key. |
| I don't remember how to throw a grenade or Molotov cocktail | Select it in the Pipboy, and hold TAB in combat to throw it. |
| I don't remember how to sheath or draw my gun. | Hold the R key. |
| [REMEMBER HOW TO HACK TERMINALS!](https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-4-guide-terminal-passwords-hacking/) | **It's VERY important to click on { [ ( etc (that highlight several characters) to remove words or reset attempts!** (it says "Dud" removed and removes a possible key). |
